|Term |  Definition         |  |
|---|-----------------------|---------|
| Focus |The distance between the lens that focuses the laser beam and the position where the beam has its smallest diameter. It is where the beam has its highest concentration of energy. |[Source](https://www.spilasers.com/application-cutting/laser-cutting-a-definition-and-jargon-buster/)|
| Power |The laser output/ how intense the laser is per unit area (1-100), frequently measured by watts per square centimeter (W/cm^2) |[Source](https://www.spilasers.com/application-cutting/laser-cutting-a-definition-and-jargon-buster/)| 
| Speed |The rate at which the laser moves. Depending on the material settings, the laser may be required to move slowly for thicker materials while other materials like cardboard can be easily cut at high speed. |[Source](https://makerfreedom.com/laser-cutter-speed-vs-power-find-the-perfect-settings/)|
| Rate  |Cutting rate (also known as production rate) is the rate at which is the frequency of the laser hitting the material. Some materials (like wood or cardboard) require low frequencies while others (such as acrylic) require higher cutting rates.    |[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting#Production_and_cutting_rates)|
| Kerf  |The width of the cutting area or the laser. Its properties are dependent on the laser properties, the thickness of the workpiece, and the type of material being used, and the width ranges from around .08mm to 1mm. In other words, this is the amount of material that the laser burns away. |[Source](http://www.cutlasercut.com/resources/tips-and-advice/what-is-laser-kerf)|
