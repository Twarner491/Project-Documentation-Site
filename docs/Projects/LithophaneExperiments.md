# Lithophane Experiments

A Lithophane is a piece of art made out of a thin translucent material designed to show an image in a "grisaille" color format when held up to light. 3D printers can be utilized to create some nice-looking lithophanes, a practice made easy with *3dp.rocks* lithophane generator, linked below. Due to their easy creation, I find lithophanes to be a nice medium to test slicer changes with, allowing for your time to be spent with the slicer settings, and not the file prep. This page is not documentation on the lithophane making process, but more of a portfolio of some notable lithophanes I've printed since taking up this medium.
