The Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank was my final project masterpiece during my cycle in [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/). The tank is made with a combination of digital fabrication tools and modern fabrication mediums including

 - 3D Printing
 - CNC Milling
 - Laser Cutting/Engraving
 - PCB Design & Milling
 - SMD Soldering
 - And Lots and Lots of CAD Design

 In an attempt to save some repo space, only a presentation slide and video of my Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank are displayed on this page, however, a complete documentation of this project can be read on my Fab Academy site linked in the button below, as well as in the header of this site.
