![](../images/About/avatar-photo.jpg){: align=right }

Hey! Iâ€™m Teddy Warner, and at the time of writing this, I'm a junior in highschool enrolled at Charlotte Latin School in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have a great interest in modern fabrication technologies such as 3d printing & CNC machines. I love using these interests to benefit my community through volunteering.
